// HOF

function f(a,fn){
console.log(a);
fn();
}

f(10, function exec(){
console.log("I am a HOF");
})

let arrayy=[1,2,5,100,10,1000,4,2];

arrayy.sort();  //  it sorts the array in lexographical order so if we want to sort it in increasing order then we have to pass function to it as sort is HOF.

let b=[1,2,5,100,10,1000,4,2];

b.sort(function (a,b){
 return a-b;
})

console.log(b);

when we are passing function to another function as an argument then the passed 
function is known as callback function.

problems with callback:

1) Inversion of control ( promises can resolve this issue)
2) callback hell
